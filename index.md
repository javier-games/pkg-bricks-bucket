Welcome to the **Bricks Bucket Project**!

Collection of packages that provide scripts and tools to assist you in developing games using the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/). Our aim is to simplify game development with reusable, modular components that enhance productivity.

## Bricks Bucket Core Package

The **Bricks Bucket Core** package offers essential, general-purpose methods and tools specifically designed for game development. This core package serves as the foundation upon which all other Bricks Bucket packages and projects rely.

## Bricks Bucket: Postman Collection Schema

This Unity package provides C# model classes representing the Postman Collections schema, supporting Postman Collections version 2.0. These models facilitate the manipulation and use of Postman collection data within Unity projects, making it easier to parse, generate, and integrate these collections.

## Bricks Bucket: Zeplin API

This Unity package provides C# model classes for the Zeplin API, enabling seamless integration of Zeplin design assets and data into Unity projects. The models make it easy to interact with Zeplin's data structure, facilitating Unity-based workflows that utilize design assets and specifications directly from Zeplin.

## Bricks Bucket: Localization

This unfinished Unity package provides a set of C# Enums that implement widely used international standards relevant to localization. While the project itself is no longer under development, these Enums may serve as useful resources for developers working with location-based data.
